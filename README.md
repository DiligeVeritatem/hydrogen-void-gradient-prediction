## Description
This repository publicly timestamps the prediction that cosmic voids contain a diffuse neutral hydrogen gradient increasing from the center to ~0.6 R_void. The prediction is defined by an explicit mathematical form and is falsifiable via future 21 cm intensity mapping surveys.

The full text is in `Prediction_HI-Void-001.txt`.

## Verification
This prediction's authorship and content are cryptographically anchored by the SHA-256 hash above.
